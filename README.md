# Metabolism at a glance - Exercise 2
## Black box model

In a batch fermentation experiment:

* a 2 L fermentor was inoculated with 0.02 g DW/L of yeast.
* Initial glucose concentration was 20 g/L.

At the end of the exponential growth phase, it was found that 

* the medium contained 10 g/L ethanol,
* 2.74 g DW/L biomass and
* 1.54 g/L glycerol. 
* The final glucose concentration was practically 0 g/L.

In [assignment.py](https://github.com/27410/metabolism-at-a-glance-yields/blob/master/assignment.py):
1. Calculate the specific yield coefficients for all products. 
2. Does the carbon balance close?
3. Assuming that CO2 is the only missing product, calculate how much CO2 was produced in the fermentation.
