# Metabolism at a glance - Exercise 2
## Black box model

In a batch fermentation experiment, 2 L fermentor was inoculated with 0.02 g DW/L of yeast. Initial glucose concentration was 20 g/L. At the end of the exponential growth phase, it was found that the medium contained 10 g/L ethanol, 2.74 g DW/L biomass and 1.54 g/L glycerol. Glucose concentration was practically 0 g/L.

1. Calculate the specific yield coefficients for all products (`assignment-1.py`). 
2. Does the carbon balance close?
3. Assuming that CO2 is the only missing product, calculate how much CO2 was produced in the fermentation.
